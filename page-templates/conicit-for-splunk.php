        <p>
          ConicIT enables you to send specific mainframe performance data to Splunk for further analysis.
          Mainframe Splunk connectivity that is specific and efficient is a very powerful tool of ConicIT
          which can minimize the amount of data you send to Splunk.
        </p>
        <p>
          ConicIT is the leading tool for real time anomaly detection of mainframe performance issues.
          It provides smart processing of data from the monitors of your mainframe and sends automatic
          proactive alerts about deviations from normal behavior of your system. Now ConicIT presents a new
          powerful integration with Splunk. ConicIT opens a smart gateway between your mainframe and your Splunk,
          a gateway which allows you to send only data of your choice to Splunk, on top of the unique performance
          analytics and alerts of ConicIT.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the power of big data analytical tools like Splunk, corporates often face the difficulty of bringing
          mainframe data to their analytical tools. ConicIT allows you to send the data of your choice from your
          mainframe to Splunk. Sending all the information you need and only the information you need provides
          you the benefits of Splunk analytics without spending your budget on storing huge amounts of data in it.

                    get the following advantages:
                </h5>
                <h6>
                    • State of the art proven system for performance anomalies detection
                </h6>
                <p>
                    ConicIT is constantly reading thousands of performance metrics from your mainframe monitors,
                    analyzing them, and applying unique machine learning algorithms for studying and predicting
                    the normal behavior of the metrics at each day and hour. Based on these algorithms ConicIT
                    recognizes when something goes wrong, and sends proactive alerts about performance issues much
                    before they affect your business. Along with the alerts, ConicIT provides information which allows
                    you to quickly trace the problems and to quickly solve them.
                </p>
                <h6>
                    • Any data that ConicIT is processing is made available for Splunk
                </h6>

                <p>
                    ConicIT can provide performance data or any other data from your mainframe to your Splunk.
                    It allows you to analyze data from your mainframe with correlation to other business data
                    from other sources.
                </p>
                <h6>
                    • Save huge costs by sending to Splunk only the information you need from your mainframe
                </h6>
                <p>
                    Mainframe SMF records hold huge amount of information, 99.9% of which are irrelevant for your Splunk
                    analysis. With ConicIT you save a lot of money by sending Splunk only the specific data that might
                    be interesting for you to analyze there. It’s also possible to configure ConicIT to bring deeper
                    information once an anomaly is detected. It allows you to perform postmortem analysis in ConicIT
                    and in Splunk based on wide range of metrics.
                </p>
                <h6>
                    • ConicIT also provides calculated-variables
                </h6>
                <p>
                    ConicIT has endless abilities for processing the data and for creating calculated metrics.
                    ConicIT can send Splunk both the raw metrics from the mainframe and these calculated metrics.
                    Such metrics can be ratios between variables, rate in which some variables are changing (e.g. CPU-Time),
                    or any other calculated variables that you need. Thus, it makes your Splunk analytics much
                    easier to write and much more meaningful.
                </p>
                <h6>
                    • Alerts from ConicIT are also sent to Splunk

                <p>
                    ConicIT is not limited for mainframe data, and can bring data from various sources in order to
                    analyze it and in order to send the data to Splunk.

                </h6>
                <p>
                    ConicIT is installed on an off-system Linux server (available also for zLinux), and only interact with
                    the monitors on your mainframe, thus the effect of ConicIT on your mainframe is similar for the effect
                    of regular user paging through specific pages in the monitors interface. Due to its architecture,
                    ConicIT doesn’t need to install any agents, and performs all of its calculations on the Linux box,
                    without affecting your mainframe performance.
